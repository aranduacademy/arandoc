# AranDoc: Arandu Documentation

Create documentation based on markdown


It comes with an editor with live preview.

## API

It also comes with a library for use with other programs

## Requirements

- GTK+3

## Desired qualities

I look forward these qualities:

- Incremental parsing (parse just the changes)
- Real-time live preview (not only by a button)
- Math, Cross References, Subfigures, Headers, Links, Paragraphs, Theorems,
